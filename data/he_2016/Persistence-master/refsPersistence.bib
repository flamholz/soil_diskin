@article{Spohn2018,
	Abstract = {We explore the question of how long elements cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and show that to address this question, a broader conceptual framework is needed that specifies ages and transit times. We calculated age and transit time distributions of five elements in a forest and two grassland ecosystems. Moreover, we assessed how ages and transit times of elements change in various scenarios. Mean age and mean transit time of all elements were smaller in the two grassland ecosystems than in the forest ecosystem due to the smaller element stocks in the grasslands in relation to the inputs. Phosphorus (P) had the largest mean transit time and mean age of all elements in the forest ecosystem (450 and 469 years) as well as in the high elevation grassland (82 and 80 years). Mean ages and mean transit times changed linearly with the stock in one pool. Changes in the internal cycling of elements in the ecosystem that did not imply the introduction of another pool had no effect on age and transit time. However, the introduction of a stable P pool in the mineral soil led to a divergence of mean transit time and mean age of P. Taken together, based on the probabilistic approach proposed here, we were able to precisely calculate not only the mean times elements need to transit different ecosystems and the ages they reach while cycling the ecosystems, but also the probability distribution of ages and transit times.},

@article{Parton1987,
	Abstract = {<abstract abstract-type="summary"> We analyzed climatic and textural controls of soil organic C and N for soils of the U.S. Great Plains. We used a model of soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and composition to simulate steady-state organic matter levels for 24 grassland locations in the Great Plains. The model was able to simulate the effects of climatic gradients on SOM and productivity. Soil texture was also a major control over organic matter dynamics. The model adequately predicted aboveground plant production and soil C and N levels across soil textures (sandy, medium, and fine); however, the model tended to overestimate soil C and N levels for fine textured soil by 10 to 15%. The impact of grazing on the system was simulated and showed that steady-state soil C and N levels were sensitive to the grazing intensity, with soil C and N levels decreasing with increased grazing rates. Regional trends in SOM can be predicted using four site-specific variables, temperature, moisture, soil texture, and plant lignin content. Nitrogen inputs must also be known. Grazing intensity during soil development is also a significant control over steady-state levels of SOM, and since few data are available on presettlement grazing, some uncertainty is inherent in the model predictions.},

	Abstract = {Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle{\textendash}climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430 {\textpm} 50 years versus 3100 {\textpm} 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 {\textpm} 27\%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Linear compartmental models are commonly used in different areas of science, particularly in modeling the cycles of carbon and other biogeochemical elements. The representation of these models as linear autonomous compartmental systems allows different model structures and parameterizations to be compared. In particular, measures such as system age and transit time are useful model diagnostics. However, compact mathematical expressions describing their probability distributions remain to be derived. This paper transfers the theory of open linear autonomous compartmental systems to the theory of absorbing continuous-time Markov chains and concludes that the underlying structure of all open linear autonomous compartmental systems is the phase-type distribution. This probability distribution generalizes the exponential distribution from its application to one-compartment systems to multiple-compartment systems. Furthermore, this paper shows that important system diagnostics have natural probabilistic counterparts. For example, in steady state the system's transit time coincides with the absorption time of a related Markov chain, whereas the system age and compartment ages correspond with backward recurrence times of an appropriate renewal process. These relations yield simple explicit formulas for the system diagnostics that are applied to one linear and one nonlinear carbon-cycle model in steady state. Earlier results for transit-time and system-age densities of simple systems are found to be special cases of probability density functions of phase-type. The new explicit formulas make costly long-term simulations to obtain and analyze the age structure of open linear autonomous compartmental systems in steady state unnecessary.},

This framework is expressed in the language of dynamical systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches. It is based on a set of six basic principles about the decomposition of soil organic matter: 1) mass balance, 2) substrate dependence of decomposition, 3) heterogeneity of the speed of decay, 4) internal transformations of organic matter, 5) environmental variability effects, and 6) substrate interactions. We show how the majority of models previously proposed are special cases of this general model. This approach provides tools to classify models according to the main principles or concepts they include. It also helps to identify a priori the general behavior of different models or groups of models. Another important characteristic of the proposed mathematical representation is the possibility to develop particular models at any level of detail. This characteristic is described as a modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific realizations of model structure for specific modeling objectives. This framework also allows us to study general properties of groups of models such as their qualitative behavior, time-scale of application, and their dynamic stability. For instance, we find conditions under which models are asymptotically stable, i.e. converge to a stable steady-state in the long-term, but may approach this state with or without oscillations. We also expand the concept of dynamic stability for models that include time-dependencies and do not converge to a fixed steady-state, but rather to a region of stability in the state-space. As an example of the application of the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil respiration fluxes in soil warming experiments.},

	Abstract = {The stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) is an important process in the context of global change and is strongly affected by soil use and management. We investigated the mineralization and stabilization of 14C-labeled wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw and 14C-labeled farmyard manure under different cropping systems (crop rotation, monoculture, and bare fallow) in a long-term field experiment established in 1967. Exponential decay equations were fitted to the measured data, and coefficients of the C pools and decay constants were estimated. The different organic amendments and cropping systems resulted in considerably different distributions and half-lives of three modeled SOM pool compartments. Significantly lower amounts of residual 14C-labeled material were found in the bulk soils of the bare fallow systems than the farmyard-manured crop rotation or monoculture, indicating enhanced organic matter stabilization in the latter systems. In 2004, remaining 14C-labeled amendments (as a percentage of the original application in 1967) in bulk soils were 8.7 $\pm$0.3{\%} for crop rotation, 8.6 $\pm$0.4{\%} for monoculture, 7.5 $\pm$0.7{\%} for bare fallow (all farmyard-manured), and 5.0 $\pm$0.6{\%} for straw-manured bare fallow. Humic acids extracted with 1 mol L-1 NaOH responded markedly to the different cropping systems regarding both their extraction yields and the remaining 14C label. In all cropping systems, the 14C in the extracted humic acids decreased rapidly with time. Remaining 14C-labeled organic residues in this fraction in 2004 (as a percentage of the original application in the fraction) were 0.315 $\pm$0.002{\%} for crop rotation, 0.31 $\pm$0.02{\%} for monoculture, and 0.16 $\pm$0.02{\%} for bare fallow (all farmyard manured). Our study therefore shows that the investigated humic acids are a dynamic SOM pool cycling at decadal and subdecadal rates.},
