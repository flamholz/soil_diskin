# This code looks at modeled transit times from global models 
# using Yujie's reduced complexity model approach. 
# We compare transit times before and after the reduced complexity parameters were updated
# We compare the coordinates where we have incubation data to the distribution to see 
# how well we cover the space


#### Calculate transit times for different models and parameters here: ####

#### Import temp, precip data and extract at modeled points: ####

#### Import list of coordinates where incubation data is available: #####

#### Import temp, precip data and extract at data points: ####


#### Histograms of transit times for each model, and where our points fall ####
#How much do these distributions shift before and after parameter adjustment?


#### Transit time vs MAT for TT < 100, and for all TT, for each model ####
# Also compare the points where we have data to this distribution to see how well we span it
# First plot shows all data, second plot shows just our coordinates


#### Mean age vs Transit Time - show how different the models are! ####
# This seems mostly because they are so different on age. 
# Do we have a wide enough sample coverage to differentiate bewteen all these?
# Actually the bulk of the data is very similar for all models,
# they diverge most at the extremes!
