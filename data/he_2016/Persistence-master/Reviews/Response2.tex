 Editor \\ Global Biogeochemical Cycles}

\opening{Dear Dr. Finzi}
We received answers back from a second round of reviewers in which each reviewer expressed that all previous comments were adequately addressed and no further changes were needed. Only reviewer 2 suggested a minor style change in one sentence, which we incorporated in the revised version as suggested. 

We would like to thank you for your editorial work and hope that the manuscript is now ready for acceptance. 


\closing{Sincerely, \\
